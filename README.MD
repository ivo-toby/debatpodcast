# Debat Podcast Generator

_work in progress_

This azure timetrigger function is capable of generating a RSS-feed to be used for podcast apps based on the information exposed by the API of Debat Direct. Debat Direct is the app of the Dutch parliament and will allow you to listen or watch debates in the tweede kamer (parliament buidling). You can watch live and previous debates. However; this app is not very user friendly. Using your podcast app can be a lot easier to use and the debates will automatically appear in your podcast queue.

## Current state

Still under active development. I'm also working fulltime as backend-developer so if I have time & energy to work on this, I will.

## What's coming

First release will just generate a podcast feed of all that's I can get from the API.
Other possible features I can think of;

- create feeds for specific topics/categories, types of debates, which room (planair, troelstra) and eventually debates with specific people
- podcast chapters based on who's talking (this information is available in the api)
